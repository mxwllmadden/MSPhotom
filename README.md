# Multisite Photometry Image Processing Application
This application takes raw image files produced by the Multisite Photometry System and processes those images into 1-dimensional traces representing GCaMP fluorescence. This application is capable of processing up to 5 seperate recording regions, as well as a "correction" signal fiber that is submerged in a flourophore solution. Additionally, this application can process an unlimited number of interpolated "channels", each with a different excitation wavelength, this enables use of isosbestic correction or even the use of multiple GCaMPs (engineered to have shifted flourescence excitation frequencies) in the same fiber.
